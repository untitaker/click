- If you require help setting up or using Click, please avoid using the issue
  tracker for this. Rather use the [``#pocoo`` channel on
  Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#pocoo) or the
  [``python-click`` tag on
  StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-click).

- The usual conventions for bug reports apply. If you are inexperienced in
  filing those, there are [many resources available on what information to
  include](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html)

- When requesting a feature, you should try to estimate how hard it would be to
  implement. If you notice the feature could be its own library, it might be
  out of Click's scope.
